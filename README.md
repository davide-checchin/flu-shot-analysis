# Flu Shot Learning Challenge

This repository contains my analysis for the friendly competition organized by [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/). The competition aims to predict whether individuals received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on information they shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors.

## Challenge Description

The challenge focuses on vaccination, a crucial public health measure in the fight against infectious diseases. Vaccines not only provide immunization for individuals but also contribute to community-wide immunity, reducing the spread of diseases through "herd immunity."
